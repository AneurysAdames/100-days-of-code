# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - Matthew Cranford

My goals for this round are to "code"

## R2 Day 1: April 11, Wednesday  

**Today's Progress**: Watched coding tech, added toolbar icons cursors to Pixel Art Maker, and did a bunch of stuff for final day of GWG challenge.

**Thoughts**: First day of "second" round... Lots ahead.
