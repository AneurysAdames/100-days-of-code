### Day 2: January 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished all the CSS for the weather app

### Day 4: January 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Refactored code on Local Weather App

**Thoughts** Didn't get a chance to start next project. After some feedback, I refactored my Weather App by adding a load timer for the weather data loading in and optimized my images for a faster page load.

### Day 5: January 5, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Optimized images a second time for Weather App, Started Wikipedia Viewer, Did some CodeFights.

**Thoughts** Got my images under 200kb for the Weather App. Had trouble understanding the Wiki API. Getting my button for my Wiki Viewer to animate like the example is going to be challenging. Solved my CodeFights algorithm, but it doesn't meet the time complexity. Need to practice more algorithms.
