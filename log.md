### Day 2: January 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished all the CSS for the weather app

**Thoughts** Project is done, but I'm having trouble adding one last feature to change the background image depending on the user's local weather. Goal is to complete the project tomorrow.

**Today's Progress**: Completed Local Weather App

**Thoughts** Finally launched my project. Got the dynamic background working so it displays a background based on the user's weather. Only 2 more projects left for the intermediate section.

### Day 4: January 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Refactored code on Local Weather App

**Thoughts** Didn't get a chance to start next project. After some feedback, I refactored my Weather App by adding a load timer for the weather data loading in and optimized my images for a faster page load.
